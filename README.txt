# Agenda Editor

The Agenda Editor is an application designed to manage agendas and related activities.
It is built using a modern technology stack to provide a seamless user experience and efficient backend operations.

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Spring Boot:** A powerful and flexible Java-based framework for building robust backend services.
- **Hibernate:** Object-relational mapping (ORM) for handling database interactions seamlessly.
- **RESTful API:** Utilizing REST architecture for communication between the frontend and backend.

### Frontend
- **React.js:** A popular JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
- **React Router:** Enabling navigation and routing within the React application.
- **Axios:** A promise-based HTTP client for making asynchronous requests to the backend.

## Design Choices

### Single Page Application (SPA)
The frontend is designed as a Single Page Application (SPA) using React.js.
This approach enhances user experience by providing a fluid and responsive interface without the need for full page reloads.

### Microservices Architecture
The backend is structured using a microservices architecture.
This design choice enables modular development, easy scalability, and independent deployment of different components.

### RESTful API Design
The communication between the frontend and backend follows RESTful principles.
This design ensures simplicity, scalability, and interoperability of the API, making it easy to integrate with other systems.

### Spring Boot and React.js Integration
The combination of Spring Boot on the backend and React.js on the frontend provides a full-stack Java and JavaScript solution.
This integration leverages the strengths of both technologies to build a robust and efficient application.

### Database Persistence
Hibernate is employed for handling database interactions, providing a convenient and consistent way to map Java objects to database tables.
